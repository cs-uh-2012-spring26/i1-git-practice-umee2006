### Why this is interesting
This article provides a counter-intuitive take on high-quality code. While most beginners are taught to write "extensible" code, the author argues that trying to predict the future leads to bloated, complex systems that are hard to change. Instead, by writing code that is easy to delete, you ensure that components are small, decoupled, and simple enough to be replaced entirely when requirements change.

I find the concept of "copy-paste is fine" particularly fascinating. It suggests that a little bit of repetition is better than a "wrong abstraction" that ties the whole system together.
