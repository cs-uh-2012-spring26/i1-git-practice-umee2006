### Why this is interesting
This article provides a counter-intuitive take on high-quality code. While most beginners are taught to write "extensible" code, the author argues that trying to predict the future leads to bloated, complex systems that are hard to change. Instead, by writing code that is easy to delete, you ensure that components are small, decoupled, and simple enough to be replaced entirely when requirements change.

I find the concept of "copy-paste is fine" particularly fascinating. It suggests that a little bit of repetition is better than a "wrong abstraction" that ties the whole system together. 


### Additional Comment (by Muhammad Shahzaib Hassan)

One aspect of this article that stood out to me is how it challenges the idea that *more structure always means better design*. As someone studying computer science, it was refreshing to see an argument that prioritizes *clarity and replaceability* over premature optimization. Writing code that can be deleted without fear encourages experimentation and reduces the long-term cost of maintaining outdated abstractions.

This perspective feels especially relevant in real-world projects, where requirements change frequently and flexibility often comes from simplicity rather than elaborate design patterns.
